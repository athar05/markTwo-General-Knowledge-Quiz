# markTwo-General-Knowledge-Quiz
Second CLI app learnt from neog.camp level0 

This app takes user's name as input, and asks user 5 GK questions. For each question answered correctly, the user gets a point, and for each question answered incorrectly, 
the user loses a point. 

The score is displayed at the end.
